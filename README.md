/*
1. Semantic HTML elements - What is it?
2. What is meant by this?
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning



What is the purpose of this in the css page as nothing happened even when i removed it
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
}

Do i need this piece of code in CSS?
 /*To set the background color of the website*/
.header navi ul {
    list-style-type: none;
}

Are we talking about the footer code?
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
